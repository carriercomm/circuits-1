SparkFun Electronics Eagle Rules
Last updated: November 11th, 2008


File Naming:
1) Directory names will be: 'Thingy' (no version number or product variation like 'Thingy with chip antenna')
2) File names are: Thingy-v10.brd
3) Panel names are: Thingy-Panel-v10.brd
4) Minor versions will be Thingy-v11, v12, v13. Major will be v20, v30.
5) Prototypes start in the sandbox and migrate to the store front specific category once listed on store front.


PCB Layout:
6) Create board frame on 0.05” grid. Make the lower left corner start at 0,0.
7) Change line width of the board frame to 0.008”.
8) Board frame will be square.
9) Change top silkscreen color (tPlace) to gray. Bottom silk (bPlace) to yellow. And tDocu to dark yellow.
10) Every board should have the full sparkfun logo or have the smaller SFE flame. Add the part : LOGO-SFE to your schematic. Put the box in the lower right corner area of the schematic frame.
11) Stick parts on 0.05” grid. You may not break this rule unless you have a very good reason.
12) Label any LED with it's purpose (power, status, D4, Lock, etc).
13) Label any connector: Vin, Port1, Batt, 5-9V, etc.
14) Label pins where applicable: TX, Power, +, Charge, etc.
15) Label switches and switch states: On, USB, etc.
16) When applicable, when adding labels, move vias and avoid having vias go through the silkscreen. Gold phoenix will bump labels around and make the board look bad if a via goes through the silk.
17) Use a tDocu line to get pin labels on a straight line.
18) Components will be grouped together (the resistors surrounding a transistor in the schematic will also be together on the PCB).
19) Using the autorouter is approved for prototypes.
20) Hand routing and touchup of the autorouter is expected for production boards.
21) 0.020” vias are allowed. 15mil is minimum.
22) Use 10mil traces on designs where possible. 8mil is acceptable. 7mil is minimum.
23) Use thicker traces for power lines where applicable. 12mil=100mA max, 16mil=500mA, and so on.
24) Spacing is 8mil between traces and space.
25) Use straight lines with 45degree corners. Avoid 90degree corners.
26) Use a ground pour on top/bottom layers where applicable.
27) Use a 12mil isolation setting on any ground pour. This will help prevent pours from shorting to traces.
28) Load the SparkFun.dru file containing
● 12mil Pad restrings
● 10mil Via restrings (vias tented)
● 10mil Copper/Dimension size
● 8mil trace/space


Schematic Layout:
29) All parts will be on 0.1” grid.
30) All GND connections will use GND symbol
31) All VCC, 5V, 3.3V, etc will use appropriate power symbol.
32) Every schematic will have the part FRAME-LETTER added to it.
33) Use two fiducials on each board where applicable. Add the part FIDUCIAL to the schematic.  Use the smallest 1x2mm footprint.
34) Any board that is larger than ~1” square will most likely require standoffs. Add part: STANDOFFs to the schematic. This part has a keepout layer to show you where the head of the standoff screw will fall. Make sure the head of the screw will not hit any connectors or parts.
35) Add fiducials, standoff components, and logo box to the lower right area of the schematic sheet.
36) Use dashed gray lines to separate a complex design into various smaller bits (for example, charge circuit, accelerometer, etc).


Footprints:
37) All footprints need >Name (on tNames layer) and >Value (on tValues layer). Size of both will be 0.016”. If you come across a part on a board that doesn't have this, you must change it and save the library.
38) All footprints need silkscreen or tDocu indicators showing mechanical sizes, dimensions, or anything weired about the part.
39) Silkscreen within a footprint or board should NOT go over pads or metal that will be exposed (it'll flake off easily).
40) Every new footprint and part will have a description containing part information and whether the footprint has been proven.


Panelization:
41) When panelizing a design, copy original board, paste it into a new PCB. Use a 0.1” grid, and place copies of board exactly 0.020” in between copies (all sides). No indicators for v-scoring are needed.
42) Make sure you are aware of any overhanging parts between copies. A bluetooth module antenna could over-run SMD components on the copy next door.


Assembly Sheet:
43) All assembly sheets will be in PDF form
44) All assembly sheets will have version number in tValue text below the design
45) Every part will have value next to the component. Text size should be 0.016”
46) LEDs must have color indicated
47) Any component not to be populated will have a large 'DNP' label on part.


Printing Schematics:
48) Print to PDF by hitting the PDF button in Eagle print window
49) Make sure 'Rotate' is NOT checked
50) Make sure 'Caption' is NOT checked
51) Select Sheets : 'All' to print all sheets
52) Scale factor 1
